# Decision Log - Airlines Assistant Spring AI

## Architectural Decisions

### [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Memory System Implementation
**Decision**: Implement memory-bank system with core files for project context management
**Rationale**: User-defined rules require memory system for session continuity and project context preservation
**Implications**: All significant project changes will be tracked in memory-bank files
**Alternatives**: Could use external documentation, but memory-bank provides better integration

### [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Technology Stack Confirmation
**Decision**: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5.0, Spring AI 1.0.0, Gradle with Kotlin DSL
**Rationale**: Aligns with user preferences and project requirements for modern Java development
**Implications**: Build scripts will use Kotlin DSL, Docker Compose without version attribute
**Alternatives**: Maven build system rejected in favor of Gradle per user preferences

### [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Progressive Enhancement Approach
**Decision**: Implement 5-phase progressive enhancement as defined in requirements.md
**Rationale**: Allows incremental complexity building from basic chat to advanced RAG
**Implications**: Development will follow phase-by-phase approach with clear milestones
**Alternatives**: Could implement full-featured solution immediately, but progressive approach provides better learning value

## Implementation Decisions

### [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Single Controller/Service Architecture
**Decision**: Use minimal architecture with single controller and service class
**Rationale**: Requirements specify simple architecture without unnecessary abstractions
**Implications**: All endpoints in one controller, consolidated business logic in one service
**Alternatives**: Multi-layer architecture rejected for this demo application

### [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Static Frontend Approach
**Decision**: Use static HTML/CSS/JS without frontend frameworks
**Rationale**: Requirements specify no frameworks, focus on backend AI integration
**Implications**: Modern responsive design using vanilla JavaScript
**Alternatives**: React/Vue frameworks rejected per requirements
