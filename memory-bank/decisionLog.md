**Alternatives**: Could use external documentation, but memory-bank provides better integration

### [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Technology Stack Confirmation
**Decision**: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5.0, Spring AI 1.0.0, Gradle with Kotlin DSL
**Rationale**: Aligns with user preferences and project requirements for modern Java development
**Implications**: Build scripts will use Kotlin DSL, Docker Compose without version attribute
**Alternatives**: Maven build system rejected in favor of Gradle per user preferences

### [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Progressive Enhancement Approach
**Decision**: Implement 5-phase progressive enhancement as defined in requirements.md
**Rationale**: Allows incremental complexity building from basic chat to advanced RAG
**Implications**: Development will follow phase-by-phase approach with clear milestones
**Alternatives**: Could implement full-featured solution immediately, but progressive approach provides better learning value

## Implementation Decisions

### [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Single Controller/Service Architecture
**Decision**: Use minimal architecture with single controller and service class
**Rationale**: Requirements specify simple architecture without unnecessary abstractions
**Implications**: All endpoints in one controller, consolidated business logic in one service
**Alternatives**: Multi-layer architecture rejected for this demo application

### [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Static Frontend Approach
**Decision**: Use static HTML/CSS/JS without frontend frameworks
**Rationale**: Requirements specify no frameworks, focus on backend AI integration
**Implications**: Modern responsive design using vanilla JavaScript
**Alternatives**: React/Vue frameworks rejected per requirements

## Documentation and Task Synchronization Decisions

- Private vs public repository (chose public for demo/portfolio purposes)
- Manual vs automated dependency management (chose Renovate for security)

### [2025-06-05 01:27:00] - Task Documentation Synchronization

**Decision**: Updated docs/tasks.md to accurately reflect all completed work
**Context**: Task list was outdated with all tasks marked as incomplete despite significant progress
**Changes Made**:
- Marked 28 completed tasks across Phase 1, Environment Setup, and Documentation
- Added 15 new documentation/CI tasks to track recent work
- Updated progress tracking from 0/108 to 28/123 tasks complete
- Added completion summary with phase-by-phase breakdown
- Updated timestamps and current phase status

**Rationale**:
- Accurate progress tracking is essential for project management
- Completed work should be properly documented and recognized
- Task list serves as both progress tracker and historical record
- Clear status helps determine next steps and priorities

**Implications**:
- Project status is now accurately represented (23% complete)
- Ready to begin Phase 2 with clear understanding of current state
- Documentation serves as reference for future development
- Progress tracking enables better time estimation for remaining work

### [2025-06-05 02:00:00] - Conversation Memory Implementation Decisions

**Decision**: Implemented session-based conversation memory with HttpSession integration
**Context**: Phase 2 implementation required persistent conversation memory across user interactions
**Components Added**:
- `ChatMemory` bean configuration with `MessageWindowChatMemory` implementation
- Session-based conversation ID using `HttpSession.getId()`
- `MessageChatMemoryAdvisor` integration with `ChatClient`
- DELETE endpoint for clearing conversation memory

**Rationale**: 
- Session-based memory provides continuity for each unique user session
- Using HttpSession ID as conversation ID ties memory to browser session lifecycle
- Memory window limit of 50 messages prevents excessive token usage
- DELETE endpoint gives users control over conversation history

**Implications**:
- Each user session maintains its own conversation context
- Memory persists across page refreshes within the same session
- Automatic cleanup occurs when sessions expire
- Backend stores conversation history in memory

**Alternatives Considered**:
- User-based authentication for longer-term memory (rejected for complexity)
- Client-side storage of conversation history (rejected for security/reliability)
- Custom conversation ID generation (rejected in favor of built-in session ID)

### [2025-06-05 02:10:00] - UI Enhancement Decisions

**Decision**: Implemented list formatting, Clear Chat button, and message timestamps
**Context**: Enhanced UI needed better message formatting and conversation management features
**Components Added**:
- List detection and HTML formatting for ordered and unordered lists
- Visual Clear Chat button with trash icon and modern styling
- Message timestamps with relative time formatting
- CSS enhancements for consistent styling

**Rationale**: 
- List formatting improves readability of structured AI responses
- Clear Chat button provides direct access to memory clearing endpoint
- Timestamps improve conversation tracking and context
- HTML rendering enhances visual presentation without requiring a framework

**Implementations**:
- Regex-based detection of list patterns in AI responses
- StringBuffer and Matcher for efficient text processing
- HTML containers with semantic class names for styling
- CSS using custom counters for ordered lists and styled bullets
- Relative timestamp formatting ("Just now", "X minutes ago")

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Markdown parser library (rejected for minimizing dependencies)
- Complex list detection logic (simplified to regex approach)
- Fixed instead of relative timestamps (chose relative for better UX)
- Full message deletion instead of memory clearing (chose memory-only approach)
