# Active Context - Current Session State

## Current Focus
- **Task Completion Review**: Successfully updated docs/tasks.md to reflect all completed work
- **Version Control**: All changes committed and pushed to GitHub repository
- **Documentation Status**: Project documentation is now comprehensive and current
- **Ready for Next Phase**: Phase 1 complete, ready to begin Phase 2 (Conversation Memory)

## Session Goals
1. ✅ Verify memory-bank directory existence (not found)
2. ✅ Create memory-bank directory structure
3. ✅ Initialize core memory files with project context
4. ✅ Load and validate memory system
5. ✅ Create comprehensive implementation plan (docs/plan.md)
6. ⏳ Begin Phase 1 development tasks

## Recent Changes
- [2025-06-05 01:24:44] - Updated tasks.md with accurate completion status for all 28 completed tasks
- [2025-06-05 01:22:30] - Created GitHub repository and committed initial codebase
- [2025-06-05 01:19:30] - Added comprehensive documentation, CI/CD, and licensing
- [2025-06-05 01:11:00] - Completed Phase 1 Week 1 & 2 implementation
- [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Created memory-bank directory structure
- [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Initialized productContext.md with project overview
- [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Established project context from requirements.md analysis
- [2025-06-05 00:56:32] - Created detailed implementation plan in docs/plan.md
- [2025-06-05 00:56:32] - Analyzed Spring AI 1.0.0 components and architecture requirements

## Open Questions/Issues
- **Phase 2 Planning**: Need to determine approach for MessageWindowChatMemory implementation
- **Session Management**: Design decisions needed for conversation ID generation and persistence
- **UI Enhancements**: Consider adding conversation history display in frontend
- **Performance**: Monitor memory usage as conversation history grows
- **Environment Setup**: Need to verify Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5.0, and Gradle setup
- **API Configuration**: OpenAI API key configuration and environment setup required
- **Project Structure**: Ready to create basic Spring Boot project structure per plan
- **Development Priority**: Phase 1 (Foundation & Basic Chat) is next priority

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 2: Conversation Memory implementation
2. Configure MessageWindowChatMemory with Spring AI
3. Implement session-based conversation tracking
4. Add conversation persistence across browser sessions
5. Verify development environment (Java 21, Gradle 8.5+)
6. Initialize Gradle project with Kotlin DSL per plan specifications
7. Create Spring Boot application structure
8. Begin Phase 1: Week 1 tasks (Project Setup)
