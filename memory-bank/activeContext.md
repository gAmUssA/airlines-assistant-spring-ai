# Active Context - Current Session State

## Current Focus
- **Primary Objective**: Implementation planning complete - ready for Phase 1 development
- **Current Phase**: Project planning and architecture design completed
- **Immediate Task**: Begin Phase 1: Foundation & Basic Chat implementation

## Session Goals
1. ✅ Verify memory-bank directory existence (not found)
2. ✅ Create memory-bank directory structure
3. ✅ Initialize core memory files with project context
4. ✅ Load and validate memory system
5. ✅ Create comprehensive implementation plan (docs/plan.md)
6. ⏳ Begin Phase 1 development tasks

## Recent Changes
- [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Created memory-bank directory structure
- [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Initialized productContext.md with project overview
- [2025-06-05 00:54:05] - Established project context from requirements.md analysis
- [2025-06-05 00:56:32] - Created detailed implementation plan in docs/plan.md
- [2025-06-05 00:56:32] - Analyzed Spring AI 1.0.0 components and architecture requirements

## Open Questions/Issues
- **Environment Setup**: Need to verify Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5.0, and Gradle setup
- **API Configuration**: OpenAI API key configuration and environment setup required
- **Project Structure**: Ready to create basic Spring Boot project structure per plan
- **Development Priority**: Phase 1 (Foundation & Basic Chat) is next priority

## Next Steps
1. Verify development environment (Java 21, Gradle 8.5+)
2. Initialize Gradle project with Kotlin DSL per plan specifications
3. Create Spring Boot application structure
4. Begin Phase 1: Week 1 tasks (Project Setup)

[2025-06-05 00:56:32] - Implementation plan completed, ready for development phase
